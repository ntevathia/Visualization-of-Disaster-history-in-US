## Visulaization-of-Disaster-history-in-US

FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary is a summarized dataset describing all federally declared disasters in the USA. This dataset lists all official FEMA Disaster Declarations, beginning with the first disaster declaration in 1953 and features all three disaster declaration types: major disaster, emergency, and fire management assistance. The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas that were affected by the disaster.

The key questions we are trying to answer here are, if disasters are increasingly becoming frequent over time. We want to identify states that constantly face disaster threats, duration of such disasters and understand deeper into the pattern of occurrence. Also, we want to assess the magnitude of relief programs provided by federal and state authorities to help overcome these disasters.
